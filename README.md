# Clinical Decision Support Group Project Paper Grading

This is a set of resources for evaluating student writing for the clinical decision support group project paper https://utah.instructure.com/courses/883746/pages/group-project?module_item_id=21094983 . It is broken down by main sections of the paper.

* General writing advice https://github.com/cmcntsh/PoWeRWritingGradStudents
* Highlighting and feedback conventions https://github.com/cmcntsh/PoWeRWritingGradStudents#highlighting
* At a minimum, I would strongly encourage students to run the copyediting prompt before submitting their work. It would be nice if they would also run the substantive editing prompt and address any gaps before submitting. It would also be nice if they would review their paragraphs for strong main topics and suitable organization.

## CDS Background & Justification

### Copyediting & Evaluation (spelling, grammar, punctuation)

Prompt:

```
Please list each sentence of this text in a new line, and please number the lines. In addition, please review each sentence for grammar, syntax, usage, spelling, and punctuation errors and suggest specific improvements. When suggesting revisions, please list the sentence number, the original sentence, the reason a revision might be needed, and then the revised sentence. If no revision is suggested, please indicate that no revision is needed.  Here is the text: "[paste text here inside quotes]"
```

### Substantive Editing & Evaluation (content coverage)

Prompt:

```
How well does the following text answer each of these questions? What is the clinical problem the clinical decision support (CDS) system is trying to address? What evidence is cited to indicate this is a clinical problem that needs to be fixed? How prevalent is the problem? What costs are incurred because of the problem? What are the adverse effects of the problem? Is morbidity and or mortality caused by the problem reported? How does the problem affect quality? How does the problem affect efficiency? How does the problem affect safety? What references are cited for each of these categories? What are the financial implications of the CDS project? Will the CDS system reduce or increase healthcare costs? Will the CDS system impact revenue? What CDS tools have been implemented to address this clinical problem. Are any specific examples of CDS tools to address the problem cited? How big of an impact have previous CDS tools had on the problem? What insights from previous tools are reported in the literature? How is the current proposed tool described? Why should the organization invest in this project? Here is the text: "[Paste the text you want evaluated here.]"

### Substantive Editing & Evaluation (content coverage)

Prompt:

```
How well does the following text answer each of these questions? How does the clinical decision support (CDS) system integrate into the clinical workflow? Does the existing clinical workflow need to be changed? If the existing clinical workflow needs to be changed, why will it be accepted by clinicians? What is a step-by-step description of how the system will be used? How well is the mockup of the proposed CDS system contextualized within the workflow steps?

### Substantive Editing & Evaluation (content coverage)

Prompt:

```
How well does the following text answer each of these questions? What kind of organization will use the clinical decision support (CDS) system? How is the organization described in the text? Who are the stakeholders for the project? What are the target implementation sites for the project? What are the implementation factors based on the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR)? What are the intervention characteristics (relative advantage, strength of evidence)? What is the inner setting (culture, implementation climate)? What is the outer setting (national policies and incentives)? What are the characteristics of individuals (self-efficacy, beliefs about the intervention)? What is the implementation process (planning)? What is the evaluation plan for the project? Will the study design allow the healthcare organization to determine whether the benefits expected from the CDS were realized? Will the study design allow the healthcare organization to detect any undesirable effects of the CDS system? Will the study design have enough scientific rigor for a peer-reviewed publication? Is the study hypothesis in PICO format? What is the study population? What is the intervention? What is being compared? What is the primary outcome the CDS intervention is expected to improve? What is the overall study design? What is the study setting? Who are the study participants? What are the inclusion and exclusion criteria for study participants? What are the primary study outcomes? What are the secondary study outcomes? What are the data collection methods? Here is the text: "[Paste the text you want evaluated here.]"

## APA References

Prompt: Evaluate the APA 7 formatting of the reference list (This seems to work well, except for references for websites. You should evaluate those manually.)

```
Do these references follow proper APA 7 formatting guidelines? Please suggest specific improvements where needed. Here are the references: "[paste references here in quotes]"
